# Small Tailscale for OpenWrt
Automated build of a stripped-down, UPX-compressed [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) package for OpenWrt devices with limited storage.

## Features

- **Always Up-to-Date**: Automatically detects new releases from the [official Tailscale repository](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) and triggers a build immediately.
- **Optimized for OpenWrt**:
  - Built as an `.ipk` package ready for installation via Opkg.
  - **Small Size**: Package size is reduced to around 5MB.
  - **Multicall Binary**: Combines `tailscale` and `tailscaled` CLI into a single binary to save space.
- **Official Build Standards**:
  - Built using Tailscale's official `build_dist.sh` script with the `--extra-small` flag.
  - Compressed using `upx --best --lzma` as recommended in the official documentation.

## Supported Architectures

- **x86** (i386)
- **x86_64** (amd64)
- **ARM64** (aarch64)
- **ARM** (arm_cortex-a9, etc.)
- **MIPS** (mips, mipsel)
- **RISC-V64** (riscv64)
- **PPC64** (powerpc64_e5500)
- And many others (see GitHub Actions matrix).

## Installation (Recommended)

Run the following command on your OpenWrt router.  
This script handles dependencies, repository setup, installation, and auto-update configuration.

```sh
opkg update
opkg install curl ca-bundle kmod-tun
sh -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myurar1a/openwrt-tailscale-small/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"

tailscale up
tailscale status
```

### What this installer does:
1. Installs required dependencies (`curl`, `ca-bundle`, `kmod-tun`).
2. Detects your router's architecture.
3. Adds this repository to Opkg feeds.
4. Installs the `tailscale` package.
5. Installs an auto-update script to `~/scripts/upd-tailscale.sh`.
6. Sets up a Cron job to check for updates every 6 hours.

## Auto-Update Mechanism

The installer sets up a cron job that runs `~/scripts/upd-tailscale.sh` every 6 hours.

- **Check**: Compares the installed version with the latest version in the repository.
- **Safe Update**: If a new version is found, it performs a `remove` -> `install` cycle.
  - This prevents "No space left on device" errors on devices with small flash storage.
  - Configuration files are preserved during this process.

## Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you prefer to configure it manually:

1. **Add Repository**:
   Add the following to `/etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf` (Replace `<ARCH>` with your architecture):
   ```text
   src/gz custom_tailscale https://myurar1a.github.io/openwrt-tailscale-small/<ARCH>
   option check_signature 0
   ```

2. **Install**:
   ```sh
   opkg update
   opkg install tailscale
   ```
